# Platforms of mech-toolkit

In this repository you will find:
- [3d_models](https://github.com/mech-toolkit/platforms/tree/main/3d_models) - these contain the 3mf models for 3D printing the mech's in a number of different scales and for different boards.
- [electrical](https://github.com/mech-toolkit/platforms/tree/main/electrical) - these contain  documentation on the electrical components of the mech's and wiring diagrams.

# Rest of mech-toolkit:
- [Micro Controller Unit](https://github.com/mech-toolkit/mcu) - repo contains source code for Micro Controler Units.  (The little boards on the mech that input vision, and ultrasonics and control the servos that move the mech.)
- [mechlib](https://github.com/mech-toolkit/mechlib) - a small python libary for autonomously controling mech's.  This integrates networking, vision, and motion control to control the mech.
- [pretrained](https://github.com/mech-toolkit/pretrained) - this contains releases of pre-training AI models for mechs.
